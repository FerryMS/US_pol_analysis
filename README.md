Introduction:

The United States of America is one of the most firearm populated country in the world. Shootings done by civilians and law enforcers are both a common occurence in this country. Fatal Interventions by the police is one of known issues in public safety in the United States. Prior research has stated that age and race is central to the logics that police and legal systems use to decide who to target, how to intervene, and how much force should be applied in the process of policing (Soss & Weaver, 2017).  A 2015 45-state study also reported that civilians diagnosed with schizophrenia were more than three times more likely than the general population to die due to legal intervention (Olfson *et al*, 2015).
